//more points to be remembered
/*
 * //1. Error class and its child classes are used at the time of system failure.(problem in the code running machine and environment)
 * 
 * //2. all childs/subclass of RuntimeException is there for all the old problems and bugs (which generally comes)
 * 
 * //3. All other childs of Exception class except RuntimeException is used when sources are exhausted
 * 
 * //4. In java.lang package these classes are there: Throwable, Exception, ArrayIndexOutOFBoundsException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, and IndexOutOFBoundsException
 * 
 * //5. when in a code when exception comes then the program crashes and the running of code terminates.
 * 
 * //6. if the exception is generated from try and catched by the catch block then inside the try the code upper to problem statement will run and code below the problem statement will not run
 * 
 * //7. array has a length property whereas String has a length() method
 * String[] args
 * here args is an array so it contains length property 
 * and args[0] contains String so it has length() method
 *
 * //8. try cannot be written without catch and catch cannot also written without try block
 * 
 * //9. but there can be multiple catch blocks for the one try block and its vice-versa is not true 
 * 
 * //10. both try and catch block can be empty but they must have curly braces {}
 * 
 * //11. catch block must be written just after the try block
 * 
 * //12. try is an uncoditional block whereas catch is a conditional block due to arguments
 * 
 * //13. catch block only one argument at a time which must be a class type
 * 
 * //14. nested try-catch block are allowed in java
 * 
 * //15. we don't write the whole code in the try catch because if an exception comes in between then the code below the problematic statement will not run at all
