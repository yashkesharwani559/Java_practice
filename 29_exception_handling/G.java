/*
 * steps that java takes so that it handles exception
 * 
 * 1. sensing the problem statement
 * 2. finds the appropriate exception class for the specific exception that is 
here
 * 3. create object of that exception class
 * 4. throws that object
 * 
 * 
 * //3 things that java provides for exception handling
 * 
 * //1. keywords :- try, catch, finally, throw, throws
 * //2. a java api library/framework where each exception is alloted a exception class
 * //3. reporting of problem and stops execution
