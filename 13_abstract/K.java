abstract class K{
    static{

    }
}
//this will give no error because we can create static block inside an abstract class in java

//we also know that static block is called and run only when the class is loaded and that's why no access modifier(all modifier) is applicable on it
// and if we apply any modifier in the static or instance block it will give compilation error
