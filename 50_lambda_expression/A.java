//lambda Expression -> also called lambda experssion is a short form of a method that can only be used with the functional interface

// normal method
// public void pro(){System.out.println("Hello");}

// lambda expression
// () -> {System.out.println("Hello");};
// or
// () -> System.out.println("Hello");

//means the lambda expression don't has the access modifier, return type, method name, parameter type but it contains an arrow (->) between the method declaration & definition and also a semicolon at the end.
